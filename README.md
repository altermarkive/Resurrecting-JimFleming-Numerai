# Numerai Experiments

After following an introductory course of Machine Learning on Coursera and working with data scientists on commercial projects I wanted to apply Machine Learning to something practical myself.

I chose to apply it to Numerai. It's a hedge fund where trades are determined based on predictions crowdsourced from data scientists given anonymized data.

I created a 7 part series documenting my journey through the experiments:

* [Part 1 - Basics](docs/part1.html)
* [Part 2 - First models: Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Network](docs/part2.html)
* [Part 3 - Automatic ML: auto-sklearn & Auto-WEKA](docs/part3.html)
* [Part 4 - Jim Fleming's models](docs/part4.html)
* [Part 5 - Automating with Luigi](docs/part5.html)
* [Part 6 - Evaluating predictions](docs/part6.html)
* [Part 7 - Concordant, original, 100% consistent](docs/part7.html)
